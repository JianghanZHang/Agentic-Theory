# Completion Marker: §7.8 Representation Dynamics

Timestamp: 2026-02-25T12:30:00+08:00
Status: ALL PHASES COMPLETE

## What was done

### Phase I: Foundations
- Definition 7.11 (Dual tower): L* = 力* ⊕ 立* ⊕ 丽*
- Theorem 7.7 (Beauvoir representation): L* is faithful, irreducible
- Theorem 7.8 (Camus absurdity): A = ||z|| - |φ|_eq > 0, irreducible
- Corollary 7.9 (Representation learning): Beauvoir + Camus = min_c A(c)
- Remark (Le Deuxième Sexe as tower): Destin/Histoire/Mythes = 力/立/丽

### Phase II: Universal Generation
- Definition 7.12 (Generation execution graph)
- Algorithm 2 (Contact-dynamics training for generation)
- Remark (Three instantiations table: text/image/video)

### Phase III: Universality
- Remark (Generation = locomotion on a different body)

### Phase IV: Integration
- Appendix C updated with forward reference to §7.8
- Build: xelatex SUCCESS (593,573 bytes, 0 errors, 0 undefined refs)

## Files modified
- sections/calculus.tex: +310 lines (§7.8 after line 1707)
- appendices/second_sex.tex: +3 lines (forward reference)

## Evidence
- latexmk -xelatex: "All targets are up-to-date"
