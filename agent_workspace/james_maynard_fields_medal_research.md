## 2. THE MAIN RESULTS

### 2.1 Bounded Gaps Between Primes

**Theorem (Maynard, 2013).** Let p_n denote the n-th prime. Then

    liminf_{n -> infinity} (p_{n+1} - p_n) <= 600.

Moreover, assuming the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture:

    liminf_{n -> infinity} (p_{n+1} - p_n) <= 12,
    liminf_{n -> infinity} (p_{n+2} - p_n) <= 600.

**Generalization (Maynard-Tao).** For each m >= 1, there exists a constant
C_m such that

    liminf_{n -> infinity} (p_{n+m} - p_n) <= C_m.

That is, for any m, there are infinitely many bounded intervals containing
at least m+1 primes.

**Context and history:**

In May 2013, Yitang Zhang proved the first finite bound: liminf(p_{n+1}-p_n)
<= 70,000,000, using a refinement of the Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim (GPY) sieve
combined with a deep equidistribution result for primes in arithmetic
progressions beyond the Bombieri-Vinogradov range.

Maynard's approach, obtained independently seven months later (and
independently by Tao), was fundamentally different: rather than improving the
input to the GPY sieve, he changed the sieve itself. The key innovation was
a **multidimensional Selberg sieve** that scores each element of a k-tuple
separately, rather than scoring the product of all elements at once.

**Timeline of improvements:**

| Result | Bound H_1 | Method |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim (2005) | H_1 <= 16 (conditional on EH) | GPY sieve |
| Zhang (2013) | H_1 < 70,000,000 | GPY + BFI beyond BV |
| Polymath 8a (2013) | H_1 <= 4,680 | Optimized Zhang |
| Maynard (2013) | H_1 <= 600 | Multidimensional Selberg sieve |
| Polymath 8b (2014) | H_1 <= 246 | Optimized Maynard |

### 2.2 The Duffin-Schaeffer Theorem (0-1 Law for Diophantine Approximation)

**Theorem (Koukoulopoulos-Maynard, 2019).** Let psi: N -> R_{>=0} be an
arbitrary function. Define

    A(psi) = {alpha in [0,1] : |alpha - a/q| <= psi(q)/q for infinitely
              many coprime pairs (a,q) with q >= 1}.

Then:

    lambda(A(psi)) = 0   if   sum_{q=1}^{infinity} psi(q) phi(q)/q < infinity,

    lambda(A(psi)) = 1   if   sum_{q=1}^{infinity} psi(q) phi(q)/q = infinity,

where lambda denotes Lebesgue measure and phi is Euler's totient function.

This resolved a conjecture of Duffin and Schaeffer from 1941, standing open
for 78 years. The paper appeared in the Annals of Mathematics in 2020.
See Section 3 below for full technical detail.

### 2.3 Large Gaps Between Consecutive Primes

**Theorem (Ford-Green-Konyagin-Maynard-Tao, 2014).** For the maximal gap
G(X) = max_{p_{n+1} <= X} (p_{n+1} - p_n), we have

    G(X) >= c (log X)(log log X)(log log log log X) / (log log log X)

for some constant c > 0 and all sufficiently large X.

**Context:** The classical Erdos-Rankin construction (1938) established

    G(X) >= c (log X)(log log X)(log log log X) / (log log log log X)^2

and improvements by subsequent authors (Rankin 1962, Maier-Pomerance 1990,
Pintz 1997) improved only the constant c. For over 75 years, the overall
shape of the bound remained unchanged. Erdos offered $10,000 (his most
generous prize) for anyone who could show that c can be taken arbitrarily
large -- equivalently, that the Rankin bound is not best possible.

The Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao paper [1408.4505] and Maynard's independent
work arrived within days of each other in August 2014, both proving the
bound with c growing (tending to infinity with X). The five authors then
joined forces to produce the definitive paper [1412.5029].

**Key innovations:**
1. Incorporation of the Maynard-Tao sieve for finding dense clusters of
   primes in admissible k-tuples of size k ~ log^c x.
2. A hypergraph covering lemma (Rodl nibble method / Pippenger-Spencer
   generalization) to efficiently cover prime residue classes by arithmetic
   progressions, avoiding logarithmic losses from naive random selection.
3. The Green-Tao theorem on long arithmetic progressions of primes provides
   the initial structured input.

### 2.4 Primes with Missing Digits

**Theorem (Maynard, 2016).** For any digit a_0 in {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}, there
are infinitely many prime numbers whose base-10 representation does not
contain the digit a_0.

More precisely, if S_{a_0}(x) denotes the number of such primes up to x,
then

    S_{a_0}(x) >> x^{1 - c}

for some explicit constant c < 1 (depending on the base).

**Significance:** The set of integers missing a given digit in base 10 has
only about x^{log 9 / log 10} ~ x^{0.954} elements up to x. This is an
extremely sparse set, and finding primes in such thin sets is far beyond
the reach of standard sieve methods. The result is remarkable because it
establishes primes in a set defined by a purely **digital** (non-multiplicative)
condition.

**Method:** The proof uses the **Hardy-Littlewood circle method** combined
with **Harman's sieve**. The key technical innovation is **decorrelation**:
separating the Diophantine conditions (which control when the Fourier
transform of the primes is large) from the digital conditions (which control
when the Fourier transform of the restricted-digit set is large). The
estimates rely on:

1. **Geometry of numbers** for lattice point counting.
2. **The large sieve** for controlling bilinear sums.
3. **Markov chain comparison** -- the distribution of digits is modeled as a
   Markov process, and moment estimates are obtained by comparison with this
   process, yielding the required Type I and Type II information for Harman's
   sieve to work on the minor arcs.

### 2.5 Sieve Methods and Their Limits

**Theorem (Ford-Maynard, 2024).** Consider an arbitrary non-negative
sequence (a_n)_{x/2 < n <= x} satisfying Type I estimates (control of
sum_{n equiv a (mod d)} a_n for d <= D_1) and Type II estimates (control
of bilinear sums for d in [D_2, D_3]). Then there exist optimal upper and
lower bounds for sum_p a_p depending on the ranges D_1, D_2, D_3, and a
key role is played by the geometry of special subsets of R^k.

**Significance:** This work provides a complete framework for understanding
what sieve methods can and cannot prove about primes. The lower bounds on
sum_p a_p depend on a new sieve method that is:
- **Non-iterative** (unlike Harman's sieve)
- Uses all Type I and Type II information simultaneously

The complementary construction procedure shows these lower bounds are
**best possible** in many cases, proving that a substantial Type II range
is always necessary for any non-trivial lower bound. This addresses the
**parity barrier** in sieve theory: the fundamental obstruction (discovered
by Selberg) that sieve methods alone cannot distinguish numbers with an
odd number of prime factors from those with an even number.

### 2.6 New Large Value Estimates for Dirichlet Polynomials (Guth-Maynard)

**Theorem (Guth-Maynard, 2024).** New bounds are established for how often
a Dirichlet polynomial of length N can take values of size close to N^{3/4}.

**Consequences:**
1. **Zero-density estimate:** N(sigma, T) <= T^{30(1-sigma)/13 + o(1)},
   improving the Ingham bound N(sigma, T) <= T^{3(1-sigma)/(2-sigma) + o(1)}
   in the critical range near sigma = 3/4.
2. **Primes in short intervals:** There exist asymptotic formulas for the
   number of primes in intervals of length x^{17/30 + o(1)}, improving the
   previous exponent of 7/12 ~ 0.583... to 17/30 ~ 0.567...

This is the first improvement to the Ingham zero-density exponent (1940)
near sigma = 3/4 in over 80 years.

### 2.7 Primes in Arithmetic Progressions to Large Moduli

**Theorem (Maynard, 2020).** New mean value theorems hold for primes of
size x in arithmetic progressions to moduli as large as x^{3/5 - epsilon}
when summed with well-factorable weights, extending work of
Bombieri-Friedlander-Iwaniec (who handled moduli up to x^{4/7 - epsilon}).

This series of three papers extends the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (which
gives equidistribution of primes in arithmetic progressions for moduli up
to x^{1/2 - epsilon}) to moduli beyond the x^{1/2} barrier, with various
uniformity conditions on the residue classes.

## 3. THE DUFFIN-SCHAEFFER THEOREM -- FULL TECHNICAL DETAIL

### 3.1 Statement of the Conjecture

**Setting.** Fix a function psi: N -> R_{>=0} (the "approximation function").
For each positive integer q, define the set of alpha in [0,1] that are
well-approximated by reduced fractions with denominator q:

    A_q = { alpha in [0,1] : |alpha - a/q| <= psi(q)/q for some
            integer a with gcd(a,q) = 1 }

The set of infinitely-often well-approximated numbers is the limsup set:

    A(psi) = limsup_{q -> infinity} A_q
           = { alpha in [0,1] : alpha in A_q for infinitely many q }

**The conjecture (Duffin-Schaeffer, 1941).** The Lebesgue measure of A(psi)
is determined by a single series:

    lambda(A(psi)) = 0   <==>   sum_{q=1}^{infinity} psi(q) phi(q)/q < infinity
    lambda(A(psi)) = 1   <==>   sum_{q=1}^{infinity} psi(q) phi(q)/q = infinity

**Why phi(q)/q appears.** For each denominator q, the number of reduced
fractions a/q with 0 <= a/q <= 1 is phi(q). Each such fraction contributes
an interval of length 2psi(q)/q to A_q (approximately, ignoring boundary
effects). So the measure of A_q is approximately:

    lambda(A_q) ~ 2 psi(q) phi(q) / q

The divergence of the sum therefore says that the "total expected measure"
of the limsup event is infinite.

### 3.2 The Divergence Condition

The critical series is:

    S = sum_{q=1}^{infinity} psi(q) phi(q)/q

**Convergence direction (easy -- Borel-Cantelli I):** If S < infinity, then
sum_q lambda(A_q) < infinity, and by the first Borel-Cantelli lemma,
lambda(A(psi)) = 0. Almost no real number is infinitely-often approximable.

**Divergence direction (hard -- the conjecture):** If S = infinity, then
lambda(A(psi)) = 1. The difficulty is that the second Borel-Cantelli lemma
requires independence (or approximate independence) of the events {alpha in A_q},
and the sets A_q are highly correlated when q and q' share common small
prime factors.

### 3.3 Why Not Khinchin's Theorem?

**Khinchin's theorem (1924)** handles the case where psi is **monotone
decreasing**: under the divergence of sum_q psi(q) (without the phi(q)/q
factor), almost all alpha are approximable by (not necessarily reduced)
fractions. However:

1. Khinchin's theorem does not restrict to reduced fractions.
2. Without monotonicity, the Khinchin result fails. Duffin and Schaeffer
   (1941) constructed a counterexample: a non-monotone psi where
   sum_q psi(q) = infinity but lambda(A(psi)) = 0. The issue is that
   denominators with many small prime factors create overlapping
   approximation sets.
3. The Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture replaces psi(q) with psi(q) phi(q)/q
   to correctly account for reduced fractions, and removes the monotonicity
   hypothesis entirely.

### 3.4 Gallagher's 0-1 Law (Ergodic Argument)

**Theorem (Gallagher, 1961).** For any psi: N -> R_{>=0}, the set A(psi)
satisfies

    lambda(A(psi)) in {0, 1}.

There is no intermediate measure. This is a **0-1 law**.

**Proof sketch (ergodic argument):** The key observation is that A(psi) is
a **tail event** with respect to the sequence of sigma-algebras generated
by the sets A_q. More precisely, for any integer N:

    A(psi) = limsup_{q -> infinity} A_q = limsup_{q > N} A_q

The set A(psi) is invariant under translation by any rational number (modulo
1): if alpha in A(psi), then alpha + p/q (mod 1) in A(psi) for any rational
p/q. Since the rationals are dense in [0,1], and the Lebesgue measure is
ergodic under translation by any irrational, A(psi) must have measure 0 or 1.

**Consequence for the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture:** By Gallagher's theorem,
it suffices to show lambda(A(psi)) > 0 (i.e., positive measure rather than
full measure). The 0-1 law then upgrades positive measure to full measure.

### 3.5 The Borel-Cantelli Connection

The proof strategy reduces to establishing a **quasi-independence**
(second moment) estimate. Define:

    S_N = sum_{q=1}^{N} 1_{A_q}(alpha)

which counts how many q <= N have alpha in A_q. The first moment is:

    E[S_N] = sum_{q=1}^{N} lambda(A_q) ~ 2 sum_{q=1}^{N} psi(q) phi(q)/q

which diverges as N -> infinity. By the Paley-Zygmund inequality (or
Cauchy-Schwarz), if the second moment

    E[S_N^2] = sum_{q,r <= N} lambda(A_q intersect A_r)

is at most C * E[S_N]^2 for some constant C, then lambda(A(psi)) >= 1/C > 0.

The **heart of the proof** is to show that the overlaps lambda(A_q intersect A_r)
are sufficiently controlled. The key overlap estimate is:

    lambda(A_q intersect A_r) <= lambda(A_q) lambda(A_r) * (1 + O(error))

where the error terms involve the shared prime factorization of q and r.
Denominators with many small prime factors in common create large overlaps,
and this is the central difficulty.

### 3.6 The GCD Graph Construction

**Definition.** For a finite set of positive integers N (the "active
denominators" with psi(q) > 0), define the **bipartite GCD graph**
G = (V, W, E) where:

- V and W are two copies of N
- (v, w) in E iff the overlap lambda(A_v intersect A_w) is "too large"
  relative to the independent estimate lambda(A_v) lambda(A_w)

More precisely, the edges encode pairs (v, w) where gcd(v, w) creates a
correlation that prevents the second moment argument from closing directly.

**Structure of the GCD graph.** For an edge (v, w) in the GCD graph with
d = gcd(v, w), the correlation arises because fractions a/v and b/w with
d | gcd(v,w) create overlapping approximation intervals. The measure of the
overlap is controlled by:

    lambda(A_v intersect A_w) ~ lambda(A_v) lambda(A_w) * prod_{p | vw/gcd(v,w)^2}
                                 (correction factor involving p)

The GCD graph encodes precisely those pairs where the product of correction
factors is significant.

### 3.7 The Compression Argument and Density Increment

The proof proceeds by an iterative strategy:

**Step 1: Reduce to a good GCD subgraph.** Using results about the
**anatomy of integers** (the typical prime factorization structure of
integers), Koukoulopoulos and Maynard reduce to finding a "good" GCD
subgraph: a subgraph G' = (V', W', E') and integers a, b such that:

- All vertices in V' are divisible by a
- All vertices in W' are divisible by b
- For every edge (v, w) in E': gcd(v, w) = gcd(a, b)

**Step 2: Compression.** If the GCD graph has too many edges (indicating
too much correlation), apply a compression operation that replaces the
vertex set by a denser subset where the problematic structure is more
concentrated. This is analogous to the **density increment** strategy
in additive combinatorics (cf. Roth's theorem proofs).

**Step 3: Three iterative propositions.** The iteration is reduced to
three technical statements about GCD graphs (Propositions 8.1 ff. in
the paper):
- An easier iteration step handling large prime divisors
- An iteration step for small primes
- A delicate step handling the critical intermediate range

The iteration terminates because each compression step increases the
"density" (or decreases the "complexity") of the GCD graph, and there
is a bound on how dense it can become.

**Step 4: Terminal case.** When the GCD graph has been compressed to a
sufficiently structured form, a direct second moment bound establishes
that the overlaps are controlled, giving lambda(A(psi)) > 0.

### 3.8 The Role of Graph Expansion

The GCD graph argument implicitly uses **expansion properties**. The key
insight is:

1. If the GCD graph is an **expander** (every set of vertices has many
   neighbors), then the correlations are "spread out" and cannot conspire
   to make the second moment too large.

2. If the GCD graph is **not** an expander, then there exists a small
   vertex cut (a bottleneck), which the compression step exploits to
   reduce to a simpler instance.

This dichotomy -- expand or compress -- is structurally analogous to:
- The **Cheeger inequality** in spectral graph theory (relating the
  isoperimetric constant to the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian)
- The **Szemer'edi regularity lemma** dichotomy (regular or refine)
- The **density increment** in Roth-type arguments

The GCD graph can be thought of as encoding a "dependency structure"
among the approximation events A_q. Good expansion means weak dependency
(quasi-independence), while poor expansion reveals exploitable structure.

## 4. CONNECTION TO PHASE TRANSITIONS

### 4.1 The 0-1 Law as a Sharp Phase Transition

The Duffin-Schaeffer theorem is a **sharp phase transition** in the
parameter space of approximation functions. Consider the one-parameter
family psi_t(q) = t * psi(q) for t >= 0. Define:

    S(t) = sum_{q=1}^{infinity} t * psi(q) * phi(q)/q = t * S(1)

There is a critical threshold t_c:

    t_c = 0       if S(1) = infinity
    t_c = infinity if S(1) < infinity (vacuously)

For t > t_c: lambda(A(t*psi)) = 1 (full measure -- almost all reals are
infinitely-often approximable).

For t < t_c: lambda(A(t*psi)) = 0 (null measure -- almost no real is
infinitely-often approximable).

This is exactly the structure of a **phase transition**: a control parameter
(the overall "strength" of the approximation function) crosses a threshold,
and the system switches abruptly from one state (measure 0) to another
(measure 1).

### 4.2 The Divergence/Convergence Dichotomy as Binary Lifecycle

The divergence condition

    sum_{q=1}^{infinity} psi(q) phi(q)/q = infinity  vs.  < infinity

is a **binary classification** of approximation functions:

- **Convergent regime:** The approximation resources are finite; they are
  "used up" and almost no number is captured infinitely often.
- **Divergent regime:** The approximation resources are infinite; they
  accumulate and almost every number is captured infinitely often.

There is no intermediate state. The measure lambda(A(psi)) cannot take
values in (0,1). This is a consequence of Gallagher's ergodic argument
(Section 3.4) and mirrors the **all-or-nothing** character of:

- Percolation thresholds (p_c in bond percolation on Z^d)
- The Kolmogorov 0-1 law for tail events in probability theory
- Critical phenomena in statistical mechanics

### 4.3 No Intermediate Measure: Absence of a Mixed Phase

In the language of statistical mechanics, the Duffin-Schaeffer theorem
asserts that there is **no mixed phase**. The system is either:

- **Fully ordered** (lambda = 1): approximability is universal
- **Fully disordered** (lambda = 0): approximability is negligible

The ergodic argument of Gallagher provides the mechanism: the event
"alpha is infinitely-often approximable" is invariant under rational
translations, and the only translation-invariant measurable sets (with
respect to Lebesgue measure on the circle R/Z) have measure 0 or 1.

This is directly analogous to the statement that in an ergodic dynamical
system, invariant sets have measure 0 or 1 -- there are no "partial
attractors."

### 4.4 The Sieve as a Mean-Field Estimate

In the Duffin-Schaeffer proof, the **first moment** estimate

    E[S_N] = sum_{q <= N} lambda(A_q) ~ 2 sum_{q <= N} psi(q) phi(q)/q

is a **mean-field calculation**: it computes the expected number of
approximations treating the events as independent. The second moment
estimate controls the correlations. In statistical mechanics language:

| Concept | Duffin-Schaeffer | Statistical Mechanics |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Order parameter | lambda(A(psi)) | Magnetization m(beta) |
| Control parameter | S = sum psi(q)phi(q)/q | Temperature T (or beta) |
| Mean-field estimate | E[S_N] ~ 2S_N | Mean-field free energy |
| Fluctuations | E[S_N^2] - E[S_N]^2 | Susceptibility chi |

The sieve method controls the fluctuations (second moment) by bounding
the correlations introduced by shared prime factors, much as cluster
expansion methods in statistical mechanics bound correlations between
spins by controlling the strength of their interactions.

## 5. CONNECTION TO GRAPH EXPANSION

### 5.1 The GCD Graph G(N) in the Duffin-Schaeffer Proof

For a finite set N of "active denominators" (those q with psi(q) > 0
and q <= N for a large cutoff N), Koukoulopoulos and Maynard define a
**bipartite GCD graph** G = (V, W, E):

**Vertices:** V = W = N (two copies of the active denominator set).

**Edges:** An edge (v, w) is present when the approximation sets A_v and
A_w have a correlation that is not explained by independence. Formally,
(v, w) in E when gcd(v, w) is "large" relative to vw -- meaning the
shared prime factorization creates a non-negligible overlap:

    lambda(A_v intersect A_w) >> lambda(A_v) * lambda(A_w)

The precise edge condition involves the ratio:

    lambda(A_v intersect A_w) / (lambda(A_v) * lambda(A_w))

being bounded away from 1, with the correction factor depending on:

    prod_{p | vw/gcd(v,w)^2} (1 + multiplicative correction at p)

**Edge weights.** The natural weight on an edge (v, w) is the "excess
overlap" M(v,w) := max{w * psi(v), v * psi(w)}, which quantifies the
strength of the correlation.

### 5.2 How Expansion Properties Drive the Result

The proof strategy has an "expand or structure" dichotomy:

**Case 1: The GCD graph is well-expanding.**

If every subset S of vertices in V has a large neighborhood N(S) in W
(relative to |S|), then the bilinear form

    B = sum_{(v,w) in E} lambda(A_v intersect A_w)

is controlled:

    B <= (1 + small error) * (sum_{v in V} lambda(A_v))^2

This means the second moment bound closes, the Paley-Zygmund inequality
gives lambda(A(psi)) > 0, and Gallagher's 0-1 law upgrades this to
lambda(A(psi)) = 1.

**Case 2: The GCD graph has a bottleneck (poor expansion).**

There exists a small set S in V with |N(S)| << |W| -- a Cheeger-type
obstruction. In this case, the vertices in S share an unusual amount of
common structure (e.g., they are all divisible by a common large factor a).
The compression step **exploits** this structure:

- Restrict to the subgraph induced by S and N(S)
- Factor out the common structure (divide all vertices by a, b)
- The resulting graph is "denser" (higher edge-to-vertex ratio)

This is a **density increment**: the problem becomes simpler because the
GCD structure has been partially resolved.

### 5.3 Connection to the Cheeger Constant and Isoperimetric Inequality

The **Cheeger constant** (or isoperimetric number) of a graph G = (V, E)
is:

    h(G) = min_{S subset V, |S| <= |V|/2} |boundary(S)| / |S|

where boundary(S) is the set of edges between S and V \ S.

**Cheeger inequality:**

    lambda_1 / 2 <= h(G) <= sqrt(2 * lambda_1)

where lambda_1 is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the normalized graph
Laplacian.

In the Duffin-Schaeffer proof, the analogue of the Cheeger constant
measures how "bottlenecked" the GCD graph is:

- **Large h(G):** The graph is an expander; correlations are diffuse;
  the second moment argument succeeds directly.

- **Small h(G):** There is a bottleneck set S; the compression step
  exploits this to reduce complexity.

The iteration terminates because each compression step either:
(a) increases the effective Cheeger constant (by removing the bottleneck), or
(b) reduces the total number of active vertices.

After at most O(log N) compression steps, one reaches a terminal case
where the GCD graph is sufficiently expanding for the direct argument.

### 5.4 The Role of the Anatomy of Integers and Probabilistic Number Theory

The GCD graph construction relies fundamentally on the **anatomy of
integers** -- the typical prime factorization structure of random integers
near N. Key inputs include:

**Erdos-Kac theorem (1940).** For a "random" integer n near N, the number
of distinct prime factors omega(n) satisfies:

    (omega(n) - log log N) / sqrt(log log N)  -->  Normal(0, 1)

in distribution. Typical integers near N have about log log N distinct
prime factors, and this count follows a Gaussian distribution.

**Consequence for GCD graphs.** The prime factorization of gcd(v, w) for
random pairs (v, w) is controlled by the anatomy of integers. For typical
v, w near N:

    omega(gcd(v,w)) ~ sum_{p <= N} 1/p ~ log log N

but the contribution to the GCD graph edges comes from the **atypical**
pairs where gcd(v, w) is unusually large. The anatomy of integers provides
the tools to:

1. **Classify denominators** by their prime factorization type (smooth,
   rough, typical).
2. **Bound the number of atypical pairs** that contribute problematic edges.
3. **Identify the dominant contribution** to the second moment, which comes
   from pairs sharing a specific common divisor structure.

The Koukoulopoulos-Maynard proof uses this to show that the problematic
edges in the GCD graph form a structured subset that can be handled by
the compression argument.

**Connection to Granville-Soundararajan theory.** The "pretentious"
approach to analytic number theory (Granville-Soundararajan) studies
multiplicative functions through their "pretentious distance." The
anatomy of integers provides the probabilistic foundation for understanding
which multiplicative structures dominate in GCD-type sums.

## 6. THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL SELBERG SIEVE

### 6.1 Setup

Let H = {h_1, ..., h_k} be an **admissible k-tuple**: a set of k distinct
integers such that for every prime p, the residues h_1, ..., h_k (mod p)
do not cover all residue classes modulo p.

**Goal:** Show that for infinitely many n, at least two (or m+1) of the
shifted values n + h_1, ..., n + h_k are simultaneously prime.

### 6.2 The GPY Approach (One-Dimensional)

Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim considered sieve weights of the form:

    lambda_d = sum_{d | P(n)} mu(d) F(log d / log R)

where P(n) = prod_{i=1}^{k} (n + h_i) and F is a smooth function.
The optimization is over a single function F of one variable.

### 6.3 Maynard's Multidimensional Optimization

Maynard considers weights of the form:

    w_n = ( sum_{d_1 | n+h_1, ..., d_k | n+h_k} lambda_{d_1,...,d_k} )^2

where the sieve coefficients lambda_{d_1,...,d_k} are supported on
d_1 ... d_k <= R and are chosen to be:

    lambda_{d_1,...,d_k} = mu(d_1)...mu(d_k) F(log d_1/log R, ..., log d_k/log R)

for a smooth function F: [0,1]^k -> R supported on the simplex

    R_k = { (t_1, ..., t_k) : t_i >= 0, t_1 + ... + t_k <= 1 }.

### 6.4 The Variational Problem

The key quantities are:

    I_k(F) = integral_{R_k} F(t_1, ..., t_k)^2 dt_1 ... dt_k

    J_k^{(j)}(F) = integral_{R_{k-1}} ( integral_0^{1-sum t_i} F(t_1,...,t_k) dt_j )^2
                    dt_1 ... (hat dt_j) ... dt_k

    M_k = sup_F  (sum_{j=1}^{k} J_k^{(j)}(F)) / I_k(F)

**Theorem (Maynard).** If the primes have level of distribution theta
(i.e., the Bombieri-Vinogradov-type estimate holds up to moduli x^theta),
and if M_k > 4/theta, then

    liminf_{n -> infinity} (p_{n+1} - p_n) <= h_k - h_1.

More generally, if M_k > 2m/theta, then the k-tuple H contains
at least m+1 primes infinitely often.

**Key values:** Using theta = 1/2 (Bombieri-Vinogradov):
- M_5 > 2 gives H_1 <= 600 (at least 2 primes)
- M_105 > 4 gives at least 3 primes
- For any m, there exists k(m) with M_{k(m)} > 2m

Under the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (theta = 1):
- M_3 > 4 would give twin primes (but M_3 ~ 3.02, insufficient)
- M_5 > 4 gives H_1 <= 12

### 6.5 Why Multidimensional is Better

The GPY approach optimizes over a one-dimensional function F(t) where
t = (log d)/(log R) and d = d_1 ... d_k. This collapses the k-dimensional
structure into one dimension, losing information about which of the h_i
are being sieved.

Maynard's approach optimizes over a k-dimensional function F(t_1,...,t_k),
separately tracking the contribution of each h_i. This gives:

    M_k^{Maynard} >> log k    (grows with k)

vs. the GPY value:

    M_k^{GPY} ~ 2 + O(1/k)   (bounded)

The logarithmic growth of M_k is what allows Maynard to handle arbitrarily
many primes (m+1 primes in a bounded interval for any m), which the GPY
method cannot achieve.

### 6.6 Independence from Strong Equidistribution

A crucial advantage of Maynard's sieve is that it requires only the
**Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem** (level of distribution theta = 1/2),
whereas Zhang's approach required stronger equidistribution estimates
beyond Bombieri-Vinogradov. This makes Maynard's method:

1. **Simpler** -- avoids the deep estimates of Bombieri-Friedlander-Iwaniec
   type that Zhang required.
2. **More flexible** -- applicable to many other problems (dense clusters,
   primes in polynomial sequences, etc.) where only Bombieri-Vinogradov
   level information is available.
3. **More powerful** -- achieves stronger results (H_1 <= 600 vs. Zhang's
   H_1 < 70,000,000) with weaker inputs.

## 7. OPEN DIRECTIONS

### 7.1 The Twin Prime Conjecture

The current best unconditional bound is liminf(p_{n+1} - p_n) <= 246
(Polymath 8b). The parity barrier in sieve theory prevents purely sieve-
theoretic methods from proving the twin prime conjecture (gap = 2). New
ideas beyond current sieve methods are needed. Ford-Maynard's work on
the theory of prime-producing sieves [2407.14368] precisely characterizes
what sieve methods can achieve, clarifying the boundary of current
techniques.

### 7.2 Quantitative Duffin-Schaeffer

Koukoulopoulos, Maynard, and Yang [2404.14628] proved an almost sharp
quantitative version of the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture, giving explicit
rates for how quickly lambda(A(psi) restricted to [0,1]) approaches 1
as the truncation level N -> infinity. Open questions remain about:
- Sharp error terms
- Higher-dimensional analogues (simultaneous Diophantine approximation)
- Analogues over number fields

### 7.3 Primes with Digital Constraints

Maynard's result on primes missing a single digit [1604.01041] opens the
door to many questions:
- Primes missing multiple digits simultaneously
- Primes whose digits satisfy polynomial constraints
- Quantitative bounds on the density of restricted-digit primes
- Extension to other number-theoretic functions (primes in the range of
  Euler's phi, primes represented by polynomials with restricted digits)

Maynard's subsequent work with polynomials [1510.07711] and the survey
[1910.13402] explore these directions.

### 7.4 Large Gaps: The Erdos $10,000 Problem

The Ford-Green-Konyagin-Maynard-Tao result [1412.5029] shows

    G(X) >= c(X) * (log X)(log log X)(log log log log X) / (log log log X)

where c(X) -> infinity. Erdos conjectured (and offered $10,000) that

    G(X) >= C * (log X)^2

for arbitrarily large C, or equivalently for C = 1. This would mean
the Cramer-Granville conjecture is roughly correct. The gap between the
current result and the Cramer conjecture remains enormous.

### 7.5 The Ingham Bound and Zero-Density Estimates

The Guth-Maynard result [2405.20552] is the first improvement near
sigma = 3/4 in over 80 years. Open questions include:
- Can the method be pushed further to improve the exponent 17/30?
- Connections to the Lindelof hypothesis and subconvexity bounds
- Implications for the distribution of primes in short intervals
  and the Goldbach conjecture in short intervals
- Generalizations to Dirichlet L-functions

### 7.6 Sieve Theory Beyond the Parity Barrier

The parity barrier (Selberg's observation that sieves cannot distinguish
numbers with an odd vs. even number of prime factors) is the fundamental
obstruction to proving the twin prime conjecture by sieve methods.
Ford-Maynard [2407.14368] precisely characterize the limits of current
sieve technology. Transcending the parity barrier would require:
- New algebraic or geometric inputs to sieve theory
- Connections to automorphic forms (cf. Friedlander-Iwaniec's
  asymptotic formula for primes of the form a^2 + b^4)
- Possible connections to algebraic geometry or motivic structures

### 7.7 Higher-Dimensional and Multiplicative Analogues

The GCD graph and expansion methods of the Duffin-Schaeffer proof have
found applications beyond the original problem:
- Erdos's integer dilation approximation problem [2502.09539] uses
  GCD graph techniques
- Metric number theory in higher dimensions
- Diophantine approximation on manifolds
- Analogues for multiplicative Diophantine approximation (the
  Littlewood conjecture and related problems)

### 7.8 Probabilistic Number Theory and Random Models

The Erdos-Kac theorem and the anatomy of integers, which underpin the
Duffin-Schaeffer proof, suggest deeper connections between:
- Random matrix theory (distribution of zeros of the zeta function)
- Probabilistic models for primes (Cramer's random model)
- Log-correlated fields (connections to the Riemann zeta function
  on the critical line)
- The interface between deterministic number theory and probabilistic
  combinatorics

## 9. TECHNICAL APPENDIX: KEY DEFINITIONS

### Euler's Totient Function

    phi(n) = |{a : 1 <= a <= n, gcd(a,n) = 1}|
           = n * prod_{p | n} (1 - 1/p)

### Admissible k-Tuple

A set H = {h_1, ..., h_k} of distinct integers is **admissible** if for
every prime p, the set {h_1 mod p, ..., h_k mod p} does not cover all
residue classes modulo p.

### The Bombieri-Vinogradov Theorem

For any A > 0, there exists B > 0 such that

    sum_{q <= x^{1/2} / (log x)^B} max_{gcd(a,q)=1} |pi(x;q,a) - li(x)/phi(q)|
    << x / (log x)^A

This is an "average" form of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, giving
equidistribution of primes in arithmetic progressions for "most" moduli
up to x^{1/2}.

### The Elliott-Halberstam Conjecture

For any epsilon > 0 and A > 0:

    sum_{q <= x^{1-epsilon}} max_{gcd(a,q)=1} |pi(x;q,a) - li(x)/phi(q)|
    << x / (log x)^A

This extends Bombieri-Vinogradov from level 1/2 to level 1 (minus epsilon).
Under this conjecture, Maynard's sieve gives H_1 <= 12.

### The Parity Barrier

Selberg observed that any sieve satisfying the "fundamental axiom" (a
positivity constraint on the sieve weights) cannot detect the parity of
the number of prime factors. Formally, if (a_n) is a sieve-detected
sequence, then:

    sum_{n <= x} a_n * (-1)^{Omega(n)} = 0

where Omega(n) is the number of prime factors of n counted with multiplicity.
This prevents sieves from proving the twin prime conjecture, since they
cannot distinguish primes (Omega(p) = 1) from semiprimes (Omega(pq) = 2).
