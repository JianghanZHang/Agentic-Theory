## 2. THE MAIN RESULTS

### 2.1 The E8 Lattice is the Densest Sphere Packing in R^8

**Theorem (Viazovska, 2016).** No packing of unit balls in R^8 has density
greater than that of the E8 lattice packing. The maximum density is:

    delta_8 = pi^4 / 384  ~  0.25367

The E8 lattice packing places sphere centers at all points (x_1,...,x_8) in R^8
whose coordinates are either all integers or all half-integers, and whose sum
x_1 + ... + x_8 is even. Spheres of radius 1/sqrt(2) centered at these points
fill the fraction pi^4/384 of 8-dimensional space. Every sphere touches exactly
**240** neighbors (the kissing number in dimension 8).

The proof constructs an explicit **auxiliary function** (the "magic function")
that saturates the Cohn-Elkies linear programming bound (see Section 3). This
is only the second time the sphere packing problem has been solved in any
dimension above 3 (after Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture in R^3).

### 2.2 The Leech Lattice is the Densest Sphere Packing in R^24

**Theorem (Cohn-Kumar-Miller-Radchenko-Viazovska, 2016).** The Leech lattice
Lambda_24 provides the densest sphere packing in R^24. The maximum density is:

    delta_24 = pi^12 / 12!  ~  0.001930

Each sphere in the Leech lattice packing touches exactly **196,560** neighbors
(the kissing number in dimension 24). The Leech lattice is also the unique
optimal periodic packing in R^24.

The proof follows the same LP bound strategy as the dimension-8 case, but
requires constructing a different magic function using modular forms adapted
to the Leech lattice. This was accomplished within one week of Viazovska's
dimension-8 breakthrough by the five-author team.

### 2.3 Universal Optimality of E8 and Leech Lattices

**Theorem (Cohn-Kumar-Miller-Radchenko-Viazovska, 2019).** The E8 root lattice
and the Leech lattice are **universally optimal** among point configurations
in R^8 and R^24, respectively. That is, they minimize energy:

    E_p(C) = sum_{x != y in C} p(|x - y|^2)

for **every** potential function p that is a completely monotonic function of
squared distance (i.e., (-1)^k p^{(k)}(r) >= 0 for all k >= 0 and r > 0).

Examples of completely monotonic potentials include:

- Inverse power laws: p(r) = r^{-s} for s > 0
- Gaussian: p(r) = e^{-alpha * r} for alpha > 0
- Yukawa: p(r) = e^{-alpha * sqrt(r)} / sqrt(r)

This is vastly stronger than sphere packing optimality (which corresponds to
the hard-sphere potential, a limit case). It means E8 and the Leech lattice are
optimal for every reasonable notion of "repulsive interaction," not just the
geometric constraint of non-overlapping.

The proof uses sharp **linear programming bounds for energy**, extending the
Cohn-Elkies framework, and constructs the required auxiliary functions via a
new **Fourier interpolation theorem** that generalizes Viazovska's original
magic function construction.

### 2.4 Fourier Interpolation on the Real Line

**Theorem (Radchenko-Viazovska, 2017).** There exists an explicit interpolation
formula for Schwartz functions on R. For any Schwartz function f : R -> C:

    f(z) = sum_{n=0}^{infty} f(sqrt(n)) a_n(z) + sum_{n=0}^{infty} f-hat(sqrt(n)) b_n(z)

where {a_n, b_n} are explicit basis functions constructed from weakly
holomorphic modular forms for the Hecke theta group.

Equivalently: a Schwartz function on R is completely determined by the values
of f and its Fourier transform f-hat on the set {0, +/-sqrt(1), +/-sqrt(2),
+/-sqrt(3), ...}. This is a crystallographic-type result: the function and
its Fourier transform, sampled on a specific discrete set, determine everything.

The basis functions a_n, b_n are entire functions of order 2, constructed via
integral transforms of weakly holomorphic modular forms for the theta subgroup
of SL_2(Z).

This result underpins the construction of magic functions for the universal
optimality theorem.

### 2.5 The Cohn-Elkies Linear Programming Bound

**Theorem (Cohn-Elkies, 2003).** Let f : R^d -> R be a radial Schwartz function
such that:

    (i)   f(0) = f-hat(0) = 1
    (ii)  f(x) <= 0          for all |x| >= r
    (iii) f-hat(t) >= 0      for all t in R^d

Then the density of any sphere packing in R^d satisfies:

    delta <= vol(B_d(r/2)) = (pi^{d/2} / Gamma(d/2 + 1)) * (r/2)^d

where B_d(r/2) is the d-dimensional ball of radius r/2.

This is a **dual** or **LP relaxation** bound: instead of directly analyzing
packing configurations, one searches for a certificate function f that
*proves* an upper bound. Different choices of f give different bounds; the
optimal f gives the tightest bound.

Cohn and Elkies proved numerically that in dimensions 8 and 24, the LP bound
comes within 10^{-30} of the known lattice packing densities. They conjectured
that an exact magic function exists that closes this gap to zero. Viazovska
proved this conjecture.

## 3. THE E8 PACKING PROOF -- FULL TECHNICAL DETAIL

### 3.1 The Cohn-Elkies LP Bound Framework

The proof of sphere packing optimality via LP bounds proceeds in three stages:

**Stage 1: The Poisson Summation Argument.**

Let Lambda be a lattice in R^d with fundamental domain volume vol(Lambda),
and let Lambda* = {y in R^d : <x, y> in Z for all x in Lambda} be the dual
lattice. The Poisson summation formula states:

    sum_{x in Lambda} f(x) = (1 / vol(Lambda)) * sum_{y in Lambda*} f-hat(y)

For a lattice packing with minimum nonzero vector length r (so sphere radius
is r/2 and spheres do not overlap), consider a function f satisfying conditions
(i)--(iii) of the Cohn-Elkies theorem. Then:

    Left side:  sum_{x in Lambda} f(x) = f(0) + sum_{x in Lambda, x != 0} f(x)
                                        <= f(0) = 1

because f(x) <= 0 for |x| >= r, and all nonzero lattice vectors have |x| >= r.

    Right side: (1/vol(Lambda)) sum_{y in Lambda*} f-hat(y)
              = (1/vol(Lambda)) (f-hat(0) + sum_{y != 0} f-hat(y))
              >= f-hat(0) / vol(Lambda) = 1 / vol(Lambda)

because f-hat >= 0 everywhere. Combining:

    1 / vol(Lambda) <= 1,  hence  vol(Lambda) >= 1.

Since the packing density is delta = vol(B_d(r/2)) / vol(Lambda), we get
delta <= vol(B_d(r/2)), which is the LP bound.

**Stage 2: The Optimization Problem.**

The LP bound is:

    delta_d <= inf_f { vol(B_d(r_f / 2)) : f satisfies (i)--(iii) }

This is an infinite-dimensional linear program (over the cone of admissible
functions f). The dual problem asks: find the densest packing that can be
certified by such an f.

**Stage 3: Saturation (Sharpness).**

The bound is **sharp** (i.e., achieved) if and only if there exists a packing
Lambda and a function f such that:

    (a) f(x) = 0 for all nonzero x in Lambda     (no slack in the LHS)
    (b) f-hat(y) = 0 for all nonzero y in Lambda* (no slack in the RHS)

More precisely, f must have (at least) **simple zeros** at |x| = r (the minimal
nonzero norm) and **double zeros** at all |x| = |v| for nonzero lattice vectors
v with |v| > r. Similarly, f-hat must vanish at all nonzero dual lattice points.

### 3.2 Self-Duality of E8: The Key Structural Property

The E8 lattice is **even unimodular**: it is an integral lattice (all inner
products <x, y> are integers), it is even (all norms |x|^2 are even integers),
and its determinant is 1 (det(Gram matrix) = 1).

**Consequence: E8 = E8*.** An integral lattice Lambda satisfies Lambda <= Lambda*
(every lattice vector has integer inner product with all lattice vectors).
If det(Lambda) = 1, then vol(Lambda) = 1 and Lambda* = Lambda. That is,
**the E8 lattice is its own dual**.

This is the crucial structural fact. For a self-dual lattice:

- The Poisson summation formula becomes:
  sum_{x in E8} f(x) = sum_{x in E8} f-hat(x)

- The conditions on f and f-hat at lattice points become **symmetric**:
  the function and its Fourier transform must satisfy the same vanishing
  conditions at the same points.

The E8 lattice is the unique even unimodular (= self-dual) lattice in
dimension 8. Even unimodular lattices exist only in dimensions divisible by 8.
In dimension 8 there is one (E8); in dimension 16 there are two (E8 + E8 and
D16+); in dimension 24 there are 24 (the Niemeier lattices, including the
Leech lattice).

**E8 lattice vectors and shell structure:**

- Minimum nonzero norm: |x|^2 = 2  (i.e., |x| = sqrt(2))
- Number of vectors of norm 2: 240  (these are the roots of E8)
- Number of vectors of norm 4: 2160
- Number of vectors of norm 6: 6720
- The theta function: Theta_{E8}(q) = 1 + 240q + 2160q^2 + 6720q^3 + ...

### 3.3 The Auxiliary Function f: Requirements for Sharpness

To prove E8 is optimal, Viazovska must construct a radial Schwartz function
f : R^8 -> R such that:

    (1)  f(0) = f-hat(0)                          [normalization]
    (2)  f(x) <= 0  for |x| >= sqrt(2)            [nonpositivity beyond min. norm]
    (3)  f-hat(t) >= 0  for all t                  [Fourier nonnegativity]
    (4)  f(x) = 0  for all nonzero x in E8        [vanishing on lattice]
    (5)  f-hat(t) = 0  for all nonzero t in E8*=E8 [vanishing on dual lattice]

Because E8 = E8*, conditions (4) and (5) coincide: f and f-hat must both
vanish at all nonzero points of E8 (i.e., at all x with |x|^2 in {2,4,6,...}).

More precisely, by the structure of the LP bound argument:
- At |x|^2 = 2 (the minimal norm): f must have a **simple zero** (f changes
  sign from positive to nonpositive)
- At |x|^2 = 4, 6, 8, ...: f must have **double zeros** (to ensure f <= 0)
- f-hat must have double zeros at all nonzero norms of E8

Since a radial function in R^8 depends only on r = |x|, we can write
f(x) = g(pi * |x|^2) for a one-variable function g, and the 8-dimensional
Fourier transform of a radial function reduces to a Hankel transform.

### 3.4 The Magic Function via Modular Forms

Viazovska's central insight is that functions with the required zero structure
and Fourier-eigenfunction properties can be constructed using **modular forms**.

**Step 1: Reduce to Fourier eigenfunctions.**

In even dimension d, a radial function f(x) = g(|x|^2) satisfies f-hat = f
(i.e., f is a Fourier eigenfunction with eigenvalue +1) if and only if g
satisfies a specific integral equation. For d = 8, the Fourier transform of a
radial function involves the Hankel transform of order 3:

    f-hat(t) = (2pi)^4 integral_0^infty g(r) J_3(2pi r|t|) (r|t|)^{-3} r^7 dr

Viazovska constructs two auxiliary radial functions a, b : R^8 -> R that are
eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform:

    F(a) = +a    (eigenvalue +1)
    F(b) = -b    (eigenvalue -1)

Then f = (a + b)/2 and f-hat = (a - b)/2. The vanishing conditions
f(v) = 0 = f-hat(v) for all nonzero v in E8 translate to:

    a(v) = -b(v)    and    a(v) = b(v)    =>    a(v) = b(v) = 0

So both a and b must vanish at all nonzero E8 lattice points.

**Step 2: Construct a and b via Laplace transforms of modular forms.**

Using the substitution s = pi * |x|^2, define profile functions
alpha(s) and beta(s) by a(x) = alpha(pi|x|^2) and b(x) = beta(pi|x|^2).

The Fourier eigenfunction conditions become integral equations. Viazovska
shows these can be solved using **Laplace transforms of weakly holomorphic
modular forms**.

The key construction is (schematically):

    alpha(s) = integral_0^infty phi_+(tau) * K_+(s, tau) dtau

    beta(s) = integral_0^infty phi_-(tau) * K_-(s, tau) dtau

where phi_+ and phi_- are weakly holomorphic modular forms of appropriate
weight for the groups Gamma(1) = SL_2(Z) and Gamma_0(2), and K_+, K_- are
integral kernels involving sin^2 factors that enforce the required zeros.

**Step 3: The sine factor and zero enforcement.**

The desired zeros at s = n*pi (corresponding to |x|^2 = 2n for E8 norms)
are enforced by a **sin^2(pi*tau) factor** multiplying the Laplace integrand.
Concretely, the integral has the form:

    alpha(s) ~ integral_0^{i*infty} sin^2(pi*tau) * Phi(tau) * e^{-s*tau} dtau

where Phi(tau) is built from modular forms. The sin^2(pi*tau) factor ensures
that the function has double zeros at the integers (since sin^2(pi*n) = 0),
which correspond to the norms of E8 vectors.

**Step 4: Modular forms used.**

The specific modular forms involved are:

- **E_2(tau)**: the weight-2 quasimodular Eisenstein series for SL_2(Z)
  E_2(tau) = 1 - 24 * sum_{n=1}^infty sigma_1(n) q^n,  q = e^{2pi*i*tau}

- **E_4(tau)**: the weight-4 modular form (the theta function of E8)
  E_4(tau) = 1 + 240 * sum_{n=1}^infty sigma_3(n) q^n
  Importantly: Theta_{E8}(tau) = E_4(tau).

- **E_6(tau)**: the weight-6 modular form
  E_6(tau) = 1 - 504 * sum_{n=1}^infty sigma_5(n) q^n

- **Delta(tau)** = (E_4^3 - E_6^2) / 1728: the normalized weight-12 cusp form

- Modular forms for **Gamma_0(2)**: the subgroup of SL_2(Z) consisting of
  matrices [a,b;c,d] with c even. This group has index 3 in SL_2(Z) and
  relates to the half-integer structure needed for E8.

The weakly holomorphic modular forms phi lie in the space M!_k(Gamma_0(2))
of modular forms of weight k that are holomorphic on the upper half-plane
but may have poles at cusps. Viazovska uses forms of **negative weight**
(specifically weight -2), which exist only in the weakly holomorphic category.

### 3.5 Why the LP Bound is Saturated Exactly

The saturation is guaranteed by the following chain of equalities. Let f be
the constructed magic function and Lambda = E8. By Poisson summation:

    sum_{x in E8} f(x) = sum_{y in E8} f-hat(y)

**Left side:**
    f(0) + sum_{x != 0} f(x)  =  f(0) + 0  =  f(0)

because f vanishes at all nonzero E8 points (condition (4)).

**Right side:**
    f-hat(0) + sum_{y != 0} f-hat(y)  =  f-hat(0) + 0  =  f-hat(0)

because f-hat vanishes at all nonzero E8 points (condition (5)).

So f(0) = f-hat(0), consistent with normalization. The key point is that
**both inequalities in the LP bound argument become equalities**:

- The upper bound sum_{x} f(x) <= f(0) is achieved because all nonzero terms
  are exactly zero (not merely nonpositive).
- The lower bound sum_{y} f-hat(y) >= f-hat(0) is achieved because all nonzero
  terms are exactly zero (not merely nonnegative).

Therefore vol(E8) = 1, and the packing density equals vol(B_8(1/sqrt(2))) =
pi^4 / (4! * 16) = pi^4 / 384.

### 3.6 Modular Forms for Gamma(1) and Gamma_0(2)

**Gamma(1) = SL_2(Z)** is the full modular group, acting on the upper half-plane
H by Mobius transformations tau -> (a*tau + b)/(c*tau + d).

A modular form of weight k for Gamma(1) satisfies:

    f((a*tau+b)/(c*tau+d)) = (c*tau+d)^k * f(tau)

The ring of modular forms for Gamma(1) is:

    M_*(Gamma(1)) = C[E_4, E_6]

with the relation Delta = (E_4^3 - E_6^2)/1728.

**Gamma_0(2)** is the congruence subgroup:

    Gamma_0(2) = { [a,b;c,d] in SL_2(Z) : 2 | c }

This group has **two cusps**: tau = i*infty and tau = 0. The Fricke involution
W_2 : tau -> -1/(2*tau) interchanges these cusps and exchanges Gamma_0(2) with
its conjugate.

The role of Gamma_0(2) in the sphere packing proof arises because:

1. The E8 lattice can be described using both the standard lattice Z^8 and
   the half-integer shift, and the relationship between these involves the
   index-2 sublattice structure captured by Gamma_0(2).

2. The theta functions that naturally arise in the E8 problem transform under
   Gamma_0(2) rather than the full modular group.

3. The weakly holomorphic forms in M!_{-2}(Gamma_0(2)) provide exactly the
   right space of functions whose Laplace transforms yield Fourier
   eigenfunctions with the correct zero structure.

### 3.7 Verification of the Sign Conditions

After constructing f via modular forms, two critical **inequalities** must be
verified:

    (A)  f(x) <= 0  for all |x| >= sqrt(2)    (i.e., for s >= pi in profile)
    (B)  f-hat(t) >= 0  for all t

These are the sign conditions from the LP bound. In Viazovska's original
proof [1603.04246], these inequalities were reduced to certain inequalities
involving modular forms and then verified using a combination of:

- Algebraic identities among modular forms
- Numerical (computer-assisted) verification on compact intervals
- Asymptotic analysis for large values

Dan Romik [2303.13427] later gave a fully human-verifiable proof of these
modular form inequalities that eliminates the need for computer calculation,
expressing the relevant functions in terms of theta series of a certain
20-dimensional lattice whose nonnegativity follows from the fact that it is
a sum of squares.

## 4. CONNECTION TO DUALITY AND FIXED POINTS

### 4.1 E8 = E8*: The Self-Dual Lattice as a Fixed Point

The dual lattice Lambda* of a lattice Lambda in R^d is defined by:

    Lambda* = { y in R^d : <x, y> in Z for all x in Lambda }

The duality operation Lambda -> Lambda* is an involution on the space of
lattices (up to scaling): (Lambda*)* = Lambda. A **self-dual** (unimodular)
lattice satisfies Lambda = Lambda*; it is a **fixed point** of the duality
involution.

The E8 lattice is the unique even self-dual lattice in dimension 8. The Leech
lattice is the unique even self-dual lattice in dimension 24 with no vectors
of norm 2 (no roots).

This fixed-point structure is not incidental. The LP bound is fundamentally
about the **tension** between a function and its Fourier transform: one must
be nonpositive outside a ball, while the other must be nonnegative everywhere.
For a general lattice Lambda != Lambda*, the function f and its Fourier
transform f-hat must satisfy vanishing conditions on **different** sets
(Lambda and Lambda*). For a self-dual lattice, these conditions **coincide**,
and the construction becomes tractable.

### 4.2 The Fourier Transform and Poisson Summation

The Poisson summation formula is the bridge between spatial and frequency
domains:

    sum_{x in Lambda} f(x) = (1/vol(Lambda)) sum_{y in Lambda*} f-hat(y)

For E8 (where vol(E8) = 1 and E8* = E8):

    sum_{x in E8} f(x) = sum_{x in E8} f-hat(x)

This is a **self-duality equation**: the sum of f over the lattice equals
the sum of f-hat over the same lattice. The magic function exploits this
by being constructed so that both sides evaluate to f(0) = f-hat(0).

### 4.3 Self-Dual Critical Points in Statistical Mechanics

The self-duality of E8 has a deep parallel in statistical mechanics. The
Kramers-Wannier duality for the 2D Ising model is a transformation that
maps the high-temperature partition function to the low-temperature one:

    Z(beta) <--> Z(beta*)

where beta* is the dual temperature. The **critical point** beta_c is the
unique fixed point of this duality: beta_c = beta_c*. Kramers and Wannier
used self-duality to determine the exact critical temperature of the 2D
Ising model before Onsager's exact solution.

Hugo Duminil-Copin (also 2022 Fields Medal) proved the sharpness of phase
transitions and determined critical points for the random-cluster model on
Z^2, where the self-dual point is:

    p_c(q) = sqrt(q) / (1 + sqrt(q))

The structural parallel is:

| Aspect | E8 sphere packing (Viazovska) | 2D Ising/random-cluster (Duminil-Copin) |
|--------|------|------|
| Duality | Lambda <-> Lambda* (lattice dual) | beta <-> beta* (Kramers-Wannier) |
| Self-dual object | E8 = E8* | Critical point beta_c = beta_c* |
| Fixed point type | Fixed point of lattice duality involution | Fixed point of temperature duality |
| Consequence | LP bound saturated (optimal packing) | Phase transition located exactly |
| Uniqueness | E8 is unique in dim 8 | Critical point is unique |

### 4.4 The Sign Conditions and Self-Duality

The LP bound requires:

    f(0) = f-hat(0),   f(r) <= 0 for r >= sqrt(2),   f-hat(t) >= 0 for all t

These conditions create an asymmetry: f must be "eventually negative" while
f-hat must be "always nonnegative." For a **self-dual** lattice, the vanishing
conditions on f and f-hat are symmetric, which allows the construction of
Fourier eigenfunctions (a with eigenvalue +1, b with eigenvalue -1) that
satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

The sign conditions can be understood via the uncertainty principle: a function
and its Fourier transform cannot both be arbitrarily concentrated. The LP
bound exploits this tension -- the tighter one can make f nonpositive while
keeping f-hat nonnegative, the better the bound. For E8, this tension is
resolved **exactly** by the modular form construction.

### 4.5 How Self-Duality Forces Uniqueness

The self-dual structure of E8 implies that any magic function must simultaneously
be adapted to the lattice and its dual -- but these are the same lattice. This
enormously constrains the space of possible magic functions. In the universal
optimality paper [1902.05438], Cohn-Kumar-Miller-Radchenko-Viazovska prove that
if a periodic configuration C minimizes energy for all completely monotonic
potentials, then C is **isometric** to E8 (in dimension 8) or the Leech lattice
(in dimension 24). The self-duality is essential to this uniqueness.

## 5. CONNECTION TO OPTIMIZATION AND VIABILITY

### 5.1 LP Bound Saturation = Achieving the Theoretical Maximum

The Cohn-Elkies LP bound provides a **certificate of optimality**: if one can
exhibit a function f satisfying the LP conditions with r = sqrt(2) (for E8),
then **no** packing -- lattice or non-lattice, periodic or aperiodic -- can
beat the E8 density. This is an information-theoretic bound, not merely a
comparison among known packings.

The saturation of the LP bound means that the E8 lattice achieves the
**theoretical maximum** dictated by the Fourier-analytic constraints. There
is no room for improvement: the bound and the achiever coincide.

This is analogous to achieving the Shannon capacity of a channel, or hitting
the Cramer-Rao bound in estimation theory. The optimal solution is not merely
"good" but **provably the best possible** among all configurations.

### 5.2 Universal Optimality = Optimality Under ALL Potential Functions

Universal optimality is far stronger than sphere packing optimality. While
sphere packing corresponds to the **hard-sphere potential** (infinite repulsion
at contact, zero interaction otherwise), universal optimality covers:

- **All** completely monotonic functions of squared distance
- Gaussian interactions: e^{-alpha|x-y|^2}
- Inverse power laws: |x-y|^{-2s}
- Riesz potentials: 1/|x-y|^s
- Yukawa/screened Coulomb: e^{-alpha|x-y|} / |x-y|

The E8 lattice minimizes the total potential energy for **every** such
interaction simultaneously. This is an extraordinary rigidity result: no
matter how you tune the interaction potential (within the completely monotonic
class), the optimal configuration remains E8.

Prior to this result, universal optimality was known only for:
- 1 dimension (the integer lattice Z is trivially universally optimal)
- Certain finite configurations on spheres (Cohn-Kumar, 2007)

### 5.3 Uniqueness of the Optimal Configuration

**Theorem.** The E8 lattice is the **unique** universally optimal periodic
configuration in R^8 (up to isometry and scaling). Similarly, the Leech lattice
is the unique universally optimal periodic configuration in R^24.

This means: there is exactly one way to arrange points in R^8 (or R^24) that
simultaneously minimizes all completely monotonic energies. The lattice is not
merely optimal but **the only optimum**.

The uniqueness follows from the interpolation formula. The energy of any
configuration can be expressed via the interpolation basis, and the LP bound
constraints force equality only for E8 / Leech.

### 5.4 Connection to Viability: Existence and Uniqueness of the Optimal Path

In the language of viability theory (Aubin), a **viable path** is one that
remains in a constraint set for all time. The analogous structure here is:

- The "constraint set" is the collection of all admissible point configurations
  (satisfying a minimum distance constraint, or minimizing a class of energies).
- The "viable path" is the E8 lattice: it satisfies ALL constraints
  simultaneously (optimality for all completely monotonic potentials).
- **Existence**: the viable path exists (E8/Leech exist and are optimal).
- **Uniqueness**: the viable path is unique (no other configuration achieves
  simultaneous optimality).

The LP bound framework provides the **certificate** that this is the unique
viable solution: the magic function proves that no alternative can compete.

## 6. THE MODULAR FORMS MACHINERY

### 6.1 Eisenstein Series

The Eisenstein series are the simplest modular forms for SL_2(Z). For even
integer k >= 4:

    G_k(tau) = sum_{(c,d) in Z^2, (c,d) != (0,0)} 1 / (c*tau + d)^k

The normalized Eisenstein series are:

    E_k(tau) = 1 + (2 / zeta(1-k)) sum_{n=1}^infty sigma_{k-1}(n) q^n

where q = e^{2*pi*i*tau} and sigma_{k-1}(n) = sum_{d|n} d^{k-1}.

Key instances:
- E_4(tau) = 1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + 6720*q^3 + ...   (weight 4)
- E_6(tau) = 1 - 504*q - 16632*q^2 - 122976*q^3 - ... (weight 6)
- E_2(tau) = 1 - 24*q - 72*q^2 - 96*q^3 - ...         (weight 2, quasimodular)

E_2 is **quasimodular**: it transforms as

    E_2(-1/tau) = tau^2 * E_2(tau) + 12*tau / (2*pi*i)

with an anomalous correction term. This quasi-modularity is essential for
Viazovska's construction, as the magic function requires forms that go beyond
the strict modular category.

### 6.2 Theta Functions

The theta function of a lattice Lambda in R^d is:

    Theta_Lambda(tau) = sum_{x in Lambda} q^{|x|^2 / 2} = sum_{n=0}^infty N_n q^{n/2}

where N_n is the number of lattice vectors of squared norm n.

For the E8 lattice:

    Theta_{E8}(tau) = sum_{x in E8} q^{|x|^2 / 2} = E_4(tau)

This is a remarkable identity: the theta function of E8, which encodes all
information about the lengths of E8 vectors, is exactly the Eisenstein series
E_4. This follows from the uniqueness of modular forms of weight 4 for SL_2(Z):
both Theta_{E8} and E_4 are modular forms of weight 4 with leading coefficient 1,
and the space M_4(Gamma(1)) is one-dimensional, so they must be equal.

For the Leech lattice:

    Theta_{Lambda_24}(tau) = 1 + 196560*q^2 + 16773120*q^3 + ...

The coefficient of q is zero (no roots), which is the defining property of the
Leech lattice among Niemeier lattices. This theta function is not an Eisenstein
series but can be expressed as:

    Theta_{Lambda_24} = E_4^3 - 720*Delta = E_4^3 - 720*(E_4^3 - E_6^2)/1728

### 6.3 Jacobi Forms and Their Role

Jacobi forms are functions phi(tau, z) on H x C that transform with specific
weights and indices under the Jacobi group (a semi-direct product of SL_2(Z)
and the Heisenberg group). They play a role in the universal optimality proof
[1902.05438] through the connection between:

- **Theta functions with spherical harmonics**: encoding the angular
  distribution of lattice vectors
- **Modular forms of several variables**: needed for the energy minimization
  problem, which involves all pairwise distances

The Jacobi theta function:

    theta_1(tau, z) = -i * sum_{n in Z} (-1)^n q^{(n+1/2)^2/2} e^{(2n+1)*pi*i*z}

and its relatives theta_2, theta_3, theta_4 provide building blocks for the
interpolation formulas.

### 6.4 The Weakly Holomorphic Modular Form Construction

The magic function requires **weakly holomorphic modular forms**: functions
that are holomorphic on the upper half-plane H but may have poles at the cusps
(i.e., they grow at most exponentially as q -> 0).

The relevant space is M!_k(Gamma_0(2)), the weakly holomorphic modular forms
of weight k for Gamma_0(2). For the sphere packing proof, one needs forms of
weight k = -2 (negative weight), which exist only in the weakly holomorphic
category.

A basis for M!_{-2}(Gamma_0(2)) can be constructed from:

    j_2(tau) = (eta(tau) / eta(2*tau))^{24} + 24

where eta(tau) = q^{1/24} * prod_{n=1}^infty (1 - q^n) is the Dedekind eta
function. Forms of the type:

    phi(tau) = P(j_2(tau)) / Delta_2(tau)

where P is a polynomial and Delta_2 is the unique cusp form of minimal weight
for Gamma_0(2), provide the needed building blocks.

The Laplace/integral transform of such forms yields radial functions in R^8
with:
- The correct Fourier-eigenfunction behavior (from modularity)
- The correct zero structure (from the sin^2 factor)
- The correct sign conditions (from the modular form inequalities)

### 6.5 Connection to Number Theory

The use of modular forms in sphere packing connects to deep themes in number
theory:

**1. Theta functions and representation numbers.** The coefficient of q^n in
Theta_{E8} = E_4 gives the number of representations of 2n as a sum of 8
squares in the E8 lattice: r_{E8}(2n) = 240 * sigma_3(n). This is a number-
theoretic identity relating lattice geometry to divisor sums.

**2. Hecke theory.** The Eisenstein series and cusp forms are eigenforms of
Hecke operators, and their L-functions encode arithmetic information. The
sphere packing proof uses the algebraic structure of Hecke eigenforms, not
their L-functions directly, but the connection is there.

**3. Ramanujan's work.** Modular forms were Ramanujan's central objects of
study. The tau function tau(n) (coefficients of Delta(tau)) and mock theta
functions are in the same universe. Viazovska's use of weakly holomorphic
modular forms continues a line from Ramanujan through Zagier (her PhD advisor).

**4. Moonshine.** The Leech lattice is intimately connected to the Monster
group via Monstrous Moonshine (Conway-Norton conjecture, proved by Borcherds).
The j-function j(tau) = E_4^3/Delta, whose coefficients encode representations
of the Monster group, is central to both moonshine and the modular forms
appearing in sphere packing.

## 7. THE MODULAR BOOTSTRAP CONNECTION

### 7.1 CFT and Sphere Packing

Hartman, Mazac, and Rastelli [1905.01319] discovered a precise correspondence
between the **conformal bootstrap** in 2D CFT and the Cohn-Elkies LP bound.

For a 2D conformal field theory with chiral algebra U(1)^c (a free boson
compactified on a lattice), the modular invariance of the partition function:

    Z(tau) = sum_{h, h-bar} d(h, h-bar) * q^h * q-bar^{h-bar}

under tau -> -1/tau imposes constraints on the spectrum {h, h-bar}. The
"modular bootstrap" derives bounds on the lightest primary operator dimension
Delta_1 as a function of the central charge c.

**Key identity:** The modular bootstrap bound for U(1)^c exactly equals the
Cohn-Elkies LP bound for sphere packing in d = 2c dimensions.

For c = 4 (dimension 8): the bootstrap functional that gives the optimal bound
is precisely the magic function used by Viazovska.
For c = 12 (dimension 24): the bootstrap functional reproduces the magic
function for the Leech lattice.

### 7.2 Quantum Gravity Connection

In the limit of large central charge c -> infty, the modular bootstrap
constrains the spectrum of 3D quantum gravity (via AdS_3/CFT_2). Specifically,
any consistent 3D gravity theory must have a lightest nontrivial primary state
of dimension:

    Delta_0 <= c / 8.503...

This bound is the quantum-gravitational analogue of the sphere packing density
bound in high dimensions. The magic functions of Viazovska are the finite-c
exact versions of these bootstrap functionals.

## 8. OPEN DIRECTIONS

1. **Other dimensions.** The LP bound is conjectured to be sharp only in
   dimensions 1, 2, 8, and 24. Can one prove non-sharpness in, say, dimension
   3? The Kepler conjecture (proved by Hales for d = 3) used fundamentally
   different methods. Is there a unified framework?

2. **Dimension 2 magic function.** Even in dimension 2, where the hexagonal
   lattice is known to be optimal (Thue, Toth, Hales), no explicit magic
   function for the LP bound has been constructed. The hexagonal lattice is
   **not** self-dual (it equals its dual up to rotation by 30 degrees), which
   makes the construction harder.

3. **Higher Fourier interpolation.** The Radchenko-Viazovska interpolation
   formula has been extended to higher dimensions [2002.11627] and to zeros
   of L-functions [2005.02996]. What other interpolation formulas exist?
   Can they solve optimization problems in other settings?

4. **Formal verification.** The "Sphere Packing in Lean" project aims to
   produce a computer-verified formal proof of Viazovska's theorem. Romik's
   simplification [2303.13427] removes the computer-calculation bottleneck,
   making formalization more feasible.

5. **Connections to physics.** The modular bootstrap connection suggests deep
   ties between optimal sphere packings and consistency conditions in quantum
   field theory. Can physical insights (e.g., from string theory, which
   naturally lives in dimensions 8 and 24 via the critical dimensions of
   superstrings and bosonic strings) shed light on why E8 and the Leech
   lattice are special?

6. **Non-lattice packings.** In most dimensions d >= 10, the best known
   packings are not lattice packings. Can LP methods be adapted to prove
   optimality (or non-optimality) of non-lattice packings? The three-point
   bounds of Cohn-de Laat-Salmon [2206.15373] extend the LP framework using
   semidefinite programming.

7. **Quantitative improvements in high dimensions.** The Kabatiansky-Levenshtein
   bound (1978) gives the best known asymptotic upper bound on packing density
   as d -> infty. Can Viazovska-type techniques improve the constant? The work
   of Cohn-Zhao [1212.5966] and Afkhami-Jeddi et al. [2006.02560] provide
   partial progress.

8. **Universal optimality in other dimensions.** Is the D_4 lattice universally
   optimal in R^4? Numerical evidence (Cohn-Kumar) suggests yes, but no proof
   is known. The interpolation techniques used for E8 and Leech do not extend
   directly to D_4 because D_4 is not unimodular.

9. **Crystallization.** A much harder open problem: prove that for specific
   potentials (e.g., Lennard-Jones), the ground-state configuration in R^3 is
   a periodic lattice. This is the **crystallization problem**, and even the
   simplest cases remain open. Viazovska's universal optimality result is a
   crystallization theorem, but only in dimensions 8 and 24.
